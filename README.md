#It's in the game: Saxion Tycoon
"It's in the game" is a school project where you have to build any type of game that is in some way related to Technology, we chose to build a game with the programming language: Java, we did this because Java is the main language that we learn at school, so it would be convenient to learn something from this project too for future school endeavours.
